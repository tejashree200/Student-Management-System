# Student-Management-System
<br>
<strong>REST API</strong> for Student Management System to efficiently manage <strong>student</strong>, 
<strong>department</strong>, and <strong>course</strong> entities, using <strong>Java Spring Boot</strong>. <br>
<br>
● The project contains implementations for <strong>CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)</strong> operations for seamless data manipulation, and established 
relationships between student, department, and course entities to enhance data coherence.<br>
● Utilized <strong>Spring Data JPA</strong> for easy and effective interaction with the <strong>MySQL</strong> database(backend).<br>
● I have created a basic and user-friendly frontend using <strong>HTML, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap</strong> and <strong>Spring MVC</strong> for effective 
data presentation and interaction.
